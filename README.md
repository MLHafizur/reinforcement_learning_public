# Requirements
Docker

docker-compose

# Setup
1. Install docker and docker-compose for your platfrom
2. Run `./start.sh` in the project root folder. This starts a docker container with correct port configuration.
3. Run `docker ps` at command line. This prints the port forwarding information. 
4. Go to https:/localhost/port_number where port_number is something like 32768 you find from the `docker ps` command
5. You can access the notebooks from there. 
6. If you want to exec into the container and run code there, do `docker exec -it container_id /bin/bash` where container_id is from the output of `docker ps` command
